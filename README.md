# a2a-schema

This npm package provides TypeScript definitions for the JSON-RPC Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.

These types were copied from https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/samples/js/src/schema.ts and packaged here to make the types easily available via npm.

## Installation

```bash
npm install a2a-schema
```

## Usage

```ts
import type { A2ARequest, A2AResponse } from 'a2a-schema';
```
